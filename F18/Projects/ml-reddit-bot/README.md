# Reddit Bot with Machine Learning Project
Reddit Bot that delivers a personalized feed using Machine Learning. What "personalized" means, we leave up to you, we give you all the right tools to be creative. This will all be built from scratch using Python!

## Potential Final Results
As a default project, we will make a Reddit bot that detects cyberbullying on Reddit as it happens. However, some alternative project ideas could be:

- A bot that browses /r/books to give you tailored book recommendations

- A bot that provides a summary, also called a tldr (too long didn't read), of long reddit comments

- A bot that finds you the most unique and insightful reddit posts on /r/AskReddit so that reading Reddit feels productive

## Learning Objectives

- Get familiar with Python out-of-the-box. Most introductory programming classes will make you write code that only runs on your computer and doesn't really do anything useful. With this project our code will interact with the popular site Reddit. We focus on the practical application of Python.

- Have your first taste of machine learning. Artificial Intelligence is being used widely in the software industry today, let's learn a bit about how it works!

## Tools and Technologies

[Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) as the language to power our project

[Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for machine learning

[PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to make the Reddit Bot
